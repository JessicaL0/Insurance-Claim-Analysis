## Abstract
Insurance claims are influenced by various factors, both demographic and health factors. By analyzing these factors, it allows deeper understanding of the likelihood of individuals receiving insurance claims. Therefore, we conducted analysis and carried out modeling processes on this insurance dataset to obtain information regarding the relationship between existing factors and the number of insurance claims received by patients. For the first step, we prepare the data by performing data cleaning, data transformation, and other process. For the modeling process, we used Random Forests and did an evaluation as the final step. Our findings found that there are some factors that are more influential in predicting the insurance claims, these factors are smoking status, BMI, and blood pressure.
